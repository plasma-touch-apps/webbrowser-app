  Blocks the passage of events until ownership over the related touch points is granted.

  Blocked touch events won't be discarded. Instead they will be buffered until ownership
  is granted. If ownership is given to another item, the event buffer is cleared.

  A TouchGate is useful as a mediator for items that do not understand, or gracefully handle,
  touch canceling. By having a TouchGate in front of them you guarantee that only owned touches (i.e.,
  touches that won't be canceled later) reaches them.
