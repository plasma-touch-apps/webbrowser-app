/*
  Where the ownership of touches is registered.

  Singleton used for adding a touch point ownership model analogous to the one
  described in the XInput 2.2 protocol[1] on top of the existing input dispatch logic in QQuickWindow.

  It provides a much more flexible and powerful way of dealing with pointer ownership than the existing
  mechanisms in Qt. Namely QQuickItem::grabTouchPoints, QuickItem::keepTouchGrab,
  QQuickItem::setFiltersChildMouseEvents, QQuickItem::ungrabTouchPoints and QQuickItem::touchUngrabEvent.

  Usage:

  1- An item receives a a new touch point. If he's not sure whether he wants it yet, he calls:
        TouchRegistry::instance()->addCandidateOwnerForTouch(touchId, this);
        touchEvent->ignore();
     Ignoring the event is crucial so that it can be seen by other interested parties, which will
     behave similarly.

  2- That item will then start receiving UnownedTouchEvents for that touch from step 1. Once he's
     made a decision he calls either:
        TouchRegistry::instance()->requestTouchOwnership(touchId, this);
     If he wants the touch point or:
        TouchRegistry::instance()->removeCandidateOwnerForTouch(touchId, this);
Â     if he does not want it.

  Candidates are put in a priority queue. The first one to call addCandidateOwnerForTouch() will
  take precedence over the others for receiving ownership over the touch point (from now on called
  simply top-candidate).

  If the top-candidate calls requestTouchOwnership() he will immediately receive a
  TouchOwnershipEvent(gained=true) for that touch point. He can then safely call
  QQuickItem::grabTouchPoints to actually get the owned touch points. The other candidates
  will receive TouchOwnershipEvent(gained=false) and will no longer receive UnownedTouchEvents
  for that touch point. They will have to undo whatever action they were performing with that
  touch point.

  But if the top-candidate calls removeCandidateOwnerForTouch() instead, he's popped from the
  candidacy queue and ownership is given to the new top-most candidate if he has already
  made his decision, that is.

  The TouchRegistry cannot enforce the results of this pointer ownership negotiation (i.e.,
  who gets to grab the touch points) as that would clash with QQuickWindow's input event
  dispatching logic. The candidates have to respect the decision and grab the touch points
  themselves.

  If an item wants ownership over touches as soon as he receives the TouchBegin for them, his step 1
  would be instead:
        TouchRegistry::instance()->requestTouchOwnership(touchId, this);
        return true;
  He would then be notified once ownership has been granted to him, from which point onwards he could
  safely assume other TouchRegistry users wouldn't snatch this touch away from him.

  Items oblivious to TouchRegistry will lose their touch points without warning, just like in plain Qt.
